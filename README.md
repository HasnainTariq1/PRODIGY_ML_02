Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering


Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using KMeans clustering on the Mall_Customers.csv dataset. The aim is to categorize customers based on their Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100) into distinct clusters.

The segmentation can help businesses better understand their customer groups and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer.
Age: The age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending patterns.


For this analysis, we focus on the Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100) columns.
